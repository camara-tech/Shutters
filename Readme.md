Shutters
--------

This is a sample website built for an interview test.

Technologies used:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript
* jQuery
* knockoutJS

I used JSON files to simulate returning results from the server.

This currently only works in Firefox and Internet Explorer(you may have to explicitly permit scripts to run) if you open the html file directly from the drive. 
Google Chrome refuses to perform the AJAX request that loads the JSON files from the drive.
